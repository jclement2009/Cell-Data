# Cell-Data
A project that explores individual choices on use of cellphones or landline phones over 1993-2010.  I find that a multinomial logit is appropriate in exploring the individual choice of 
* Owning a cellphone only 
* Owning a landline only 
* Owning both modes
* Owning neither

The exogenous (Right-hand side) variables include 
* Family size
* Real income 
* Gender
* Age 
* Year
* If the subject has a college degree
* If the subject is married
* If the subject lives in an urban area
* If the subject is caucasian 

I have a working version of this project using a Stata script. However, I am replicating the results using both Python and R as these are more accessible than Stata in terms of price.
